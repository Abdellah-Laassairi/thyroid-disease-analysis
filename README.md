# Thyroid disease analysis project. 

This is an Academic project for the R Course at Ecole Centrale de Nantes, applied mathematics major.

## About the dataset 
The data is in the .csv file thyroid.csv . It consists of  3772 rows (patients) on whom  variables were reported, namely:

## Objectives of the project 

- Create a dashboard with tabs:
    - one for a recap of numbers of individual patients (allowing the user to choose the patient);
    - one with intuitive viz or data table summaries of individual variables (possibly by subgroups);
    - one for comparing groups of patients (allowing the user to choose the variable(s) by which grouping the data).
- Separately generate a HTML report providing insight into which variables might be the best preditors of thyroid disease.
- Handle missing value properly:
    - Create new variables that are copies of variables with missing values where the missing values have been imputed. Justify the method;
    - In the dashboard, when a displayed number comes from your imputation process, find a way to signal it to the user.
